## diy iPad audio input with speaker output

I wanted to connect a [Rakit oscillator](https://www.rakits.co.uk/assembly-guides/mini-apc/) to an iPad, so I could run it through some effects before sending to a speaker. It's the same idea as using something like the [iRig](https://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/irig2/), but given the current situation in the world can't just pick one up at the shop. So I hacked one together from a few old 3 and 4-conductor microphone/headphone connectors I had lying around. It's not perfect since I'm only sending one channel from the apc output - maybe I could just wire R & L together to the mic in.
