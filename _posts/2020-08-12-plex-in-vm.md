I want to run Plex in a VM, so my host stays clean of the install and I can easily recreate it if I want to. 
I also want to keep the media files on separate disk array on the host, while keeping the plex vm small. To do that, in the guest, get can mount a share from the host using smb.

## Running Plex in a Linux VM on a Windows host

Provision an Ubuntu VM with port forwarding, smbclient, and install plex:

{% highlight bash %}
config.vm.box = "ubuntu/xenial64"
config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 32400, host: 8080
config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
  vb.memory = "8192"
  vb.cpus = 4
end
config.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
  wget https://downloads.plex.tv/plex-media-server-new/1.19.3.2843-e3c1f7bcd/debian/plexmediaserver_1.19.3.2843-e3c1f7bcd_amd64.deb
  sudo dpkg -i plexmediaserver_1.19.3.2843-e3c1f7bcd_amd64.deb
  rm plexmediaserver_1.14.0.5470-9d51fdfaa_amd64.deb
  sudo apt-get install cifs-utils smbclient
  sudo apt-get install htop
SHELL
{% endhighlight %}

Then in the host, share the media directory with an authorised credential.

## Mounting the share in the guest

Then, in the guest, get the gateway IP to connect to the host:

{% highlight bash %}
$ netstat -rn
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface
0.0.0.0         10.0.2.2        0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0 enp0s3
10.0.2.0        0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U         0 0          0 enp0s3
{% endhighlight %}

And add to your fstab:

{% highlight bash %}
//10.0.2.2/data /media/share cifs vers=3.0,credentials=/home/vagrant/.smbcredentials,mfsymlinks 0 0
{% endhighlight %}

And create the .smbcredentials file with your host username/password.

Then mount -av and you should be good! This could have all been incorporated into the provisioning script, but hey.
