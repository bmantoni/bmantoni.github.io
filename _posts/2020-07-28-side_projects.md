Fun Projects on the Side

**[PIC Emulator](/pic-emulator-part-1/)**
Using Dart to write my first emulator, of an 8-bit PIC microcontroller

**[2 Player Web-based Football Game](https://github.com/bmantoni/futbol)**
A simple football-like multiplayer game to explore basic multiplayer state synchronisation.

**[Zombie Simulator](https://github.com/bmantoni/zombie-sim)**
A game written in Flutter to simulate how a horde of zombies can impart force on obstacles. It was a fun way to try my hand at creating sprite sheets and pixelated animations and using a very simple "AI" to see if the group, moving semi-randomly, but with some attractions, could end up coordinating enough force to break through barricades.

**[Arduino-Powered Musical Statues Toy](https://github.com/bmantoni/arduino-musical-statues)**
Using an Arduino, an MP3 module, some LED strip, and a PIR sensor, packaged up into an enclosure, to create a fun game for the kids. It plays music while the kids dance and will randomly say STOP and watch to see if everyone stays still.
